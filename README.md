## Why PINAC Workspace ?

Leveraging multiple AI tools for your workflow sounds smart. However, does the constant context switching between them slow you down?

Experience the **Next Gen AI Chat** —your all-in-one chat for text generation, document summarization, web searching, code generation, and a wide range of office tools.

> In this we develop the frontend part of the desktop app. We develop the python server separately in our repo  <a href="https://github.com/pinacai/PINAC-Nexus">PINAC Nexus</a>. We update the server in this repo with every new version of the server.

## 🎨 Themes
