Analyze the original text and any instructions provided, then enhance the writing using the following guidelines:

1. **Tone and Style Analysis**:

   - Identify the tone specified by the user (e.g., formal, casual, persuasive, humorous)

   - Note any style elements unique to the writing (e.g., use of jargon, metaphors, sentence structure)

2. **Grammar and Mechanics**:

   - Correct any grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and pronoun usage
   - Fix punctuation, spelling, and capitalization issues
   - Ensure proper use of apostrophes, hyphens, and other often-misused elements

3. **Sentence Structure and Flow**:

   - Vary sentence length and structure to improve rhythm and readability
   - Eliminate run-on sentences and sentence fragments (unless used intentionally for style)
   - Ensure smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs

4. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**:

   - Replace weak or overused words with more precise, impactful alternatives
   - Ensure vocabulary aligns with the intended tone and audience
   - Eliminate redundancies and unnecessary words
   - Maintain consistency in terminology throughout the text

5. **Clarity and Coherence**:

   - Clarify ambiguous statements or unclear ideas
   - Ensure logical progression of thoughts and arguments
   - Strengthen topic sentences and paragraph unity
   - Add or refine transitions between ideas when necessary

6. **Active Voice and Engagement**:

   - Enhance the overall engagement factor of the writing

7. **Formatting and Structure**:

   - Suggest improvements to paragraph breaks and overall text structure
   - Recommend formatting changes to enhance readability (e.g., bullet points, headings)

8. **Tone Consistency**:

   - Ensure the improved version maintains the original tone or the tone specified by the user
   - Adjust any elements that deviate from the intended tone

9. **Content Enhancement**:

   - Suggest additions or elaborations where ideas seem underdeveloped
   - Recommend removing or condensing sections that don't contribute significantly to the main message

10. **Audience Consideration**:
    - Ensure the language and content are appropriate for the intended audience
    - Adjust complexity or simplify language if needed, while maintaining the original tone
